Hi, My name is Carl and I am 19 years old.

I am a student in CNA and currently taking a course 'Software Development Co-op' and I am currently in my first year. I have started my coding journey in 2022 and I fell in love with it since.
My first programming languange that I learned was HTML and CSS. In my college, I touched a lot on Python and Databases. Hopefully, I can become a full stack developer in the future since I enjoy working with websites. Currently learning more about both Front-end and Back-end.

About me:
- 👀 I’m interested in basketball, web development, and videogames.
- 🌱 I’m currently self teaching myself to learn Javascript.
- 🍳 Fun Fact: I enjoy learning and cooking filipino dishes.
- 🎮 Favourite all time video game character is Clementine.
- 🏴‍☠️ A fan of One Piece.
- 🏋️ Yeah Buddy! (Ronnie Coleman👑)
- 🎵 Favourite artist of all time is Bon Jovi🎙️.
- ⭐ Dream of becoming a full stack developer in the future.
